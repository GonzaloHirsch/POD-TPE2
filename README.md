# TPE2 - POD

## How to download dataset
In order to download the datasets, it can be done with SCP:
```
scp USERNAME@pampero.itba.edu.ar:/afs/it.itba.edu.ar/pub/pod/FILE.csv LOCAL_PATH
```
Where LOCAL_PATH is the path to where the file will be downloaded to (it can be moved later)

Files can be placed in an **examples** directory in the root of the project.
